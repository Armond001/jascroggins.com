<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using Javascript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>
<script>

  // this will set the loop control variable 
  let whileCount = 0;

  // this while loop will count to 4
  while(whileCount < 5){

    // this script will write each numbber in it on paragraph so they are on seperate lines 
    document.write("<p>" +  whileCount + "</p>");

    // this will up date the count of the loop
    whileCount++;

  }
</script>
<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
<script>
  // this for loop will count down from 4 to 0 
  for(x=4;x>=0 ;x--){

    // this script will write each numbber in it on paragraph so they are on seperate lines 
    document.write("<p>" +  x + "</p>");
  }
</script>
<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
<script>
  // this loop will start at 1 and count to 5 
  for(y=1;y<6;y++){
  // this script will take the count and write it out in a paragraph element 
    document.write("<p>" +  y + "</p>");
  }
</script>
<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
<script>
  // this will set the control variable to 5 
  let count40= 5;

  // this loop will continoue till it reaches 40
  while(count40<=40){

    // this script will write ou the count with a comma inbetween each count 
    document.write(count40 + ",");

    // this will update the count of the loop at an interval of 5 
    count40 += 5;
  }
</script>
<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>
<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select">
      <script>

        //this loop will start at 1 and count to 6
        for(j=1;j<=6;j++){
          // this will create an new option in the form with each count and write out option + the count 
          document.write("<option>" + "option " + j + "</option>");
        }
      </script>
    </select>
  </label>
</p>
