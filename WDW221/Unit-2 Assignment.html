	var schoolName ;
	console.log(schoolName);//1. its staes a variable but dose not define it //

	var schoolName =("DMACC");
    console.log(schoolName);//2. it define schoolName as string and writes DMACC in the console log//


	var schoolName =(42);
    console.log(schoolName);//3. this rededines school Name as a number value //


	let  courseName = (" WDV221 Intro Javascript");//4. this defines courseName as a string and then is called in later into the dom using a document.wrte//

  let testScore=(100.00);
  console.log(testScore);//5.defines testScore as a number value and drops any repeating 0's//

  let courseGrade=(88.65);
  console.log(courseGrade);//6. redefines testScore and keeps the numbers after the decimal becuase they ARE NOT REPEATING 0'S//

  var courseCompleted=(false);
  console.log(courseCompleted);// defines courseCompleted as a boolean with the value of false //

  var courseCompleted=("false");
  console.log(courseCompleted);//8.redefines courseCompleted as a string //

  let stringType=("jacob");
  console.log(stringType);//9.defines stringType as a string and displays it in the console//

  let numberType=(21);
  console.log(numberType)//10.defines numberType as a number value and displays it in the console//

<hr />
<p>1. Define a variable call schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *Review the value of a variable that has been defined but has not been assigned a value.</p>
<p>2. Assign &quot;DMACC&quot; to schoolName. Display the variable in the console.  *The quotes make this a String data type.</p>
<p>3. Assignment 42 to schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *This changes the datatype of the variable from a String to a number. Notice that a JavaScript variable changes datatype based upon it contents.</p>
<p>4. Define a variable called courseName and assign it a value of WDV221 Intro Javascript. Use document.write() to display the value of the variable within the following paragraph instead of courseName shown below.</p>
	<p>Hello! Welcome to <em><script>document.write(courseName);//4.//</script></em>.</p>
<p>5. Define a variable called testScore and assign it a value of 100.00. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats the .00.</p>
<p>6. Define a variable called courseGrade. Assign it a value of 88.65. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats this number.</p>
<p>7. Define a variable called courseCompleted. Give it a value of false. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice this is NOT a String datatype. true and false are reserved word within Javascript.</p>
<p>8. Assign a value of &quot;false&quot; to courseCompleted. Make sure and use the &quot;&quot; to make this a String datatype. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice the difference between 7 and 8.</p>
<p>9. Create a variable called stringType. Assign it a value that makes the variable String data type. Use console.log( ) to display the variable stringType</p>
<p>10. Create a variable called numberType. Assign it a value that makes the variable a number data type. Use console.log( ) to display the variable numberType.</p>
