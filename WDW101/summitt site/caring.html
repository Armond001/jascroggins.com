           <h2> outine Care, Diet, and Exercise</h2>
           <p> Build her routine care into your schedule to help your Mal live longer, stay healthier, and be happier during her lifetime. We cannot overemphasize the importance of a proper diet and exercise routine.</p>

           <ul>
                <li> Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors closed, pick up after yourself, and block off rooms as necessary. This will keep her out of trouble and away from objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.</li>
                   <li> Brush her coat as needed, at least weekly.</li>

                 <li>Alaskan Malamutes often have serious problems with their teeth, so you’ll need to brush them at least three times a week!</li>

                <li>Clean her ears weekly, even as a puppy. Don’t worry—we’ll show you how!
                 <li>She's a large dog with lots of energy, so keep her mind and body active, or she'll get bored. That's when the naughty stuff starts.</li>
                  <li>are expert diggers and climbers. It is recommended that you bury your fence and that it is at least 6 feet tall.</li>
                 <li>can be affected by snow nose, which is a loss of pigment from the nose, making her prone to sunburn. She will need dog-safe sunscreen.</li>
                <li>Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give her people food.</li>
                <li>Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for her age.</li>
                 <li>Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.</li>
