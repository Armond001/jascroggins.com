            <p>during this time europe would dicover cooca. the first european encounter with it being Chrisopher Columbus.Then later <i>Herman Cortes</i> would come in contact with cocoa when meeting the Aztecs and then counquoring them.
                After he stared plantaions using the cocoa to buy slaves and wealth. soon after the Cocoa bean had made its way to europe first as a medicine. it wasnt until the 1550s when it was consumed with sweeteners and spices.  </p>
              

            <h3>present day</h3>
            <p>Up before the first world war chocolate was a luxary treat only enjoyed on special occasions. After world war 1 with industrialization now in full gear chocolate started becoming another comodity now easy accessable to middle class and lower class peoples. at the time and still today there are health benifets assumed to be related to chocolate, though some of these benifets were suppressed in the 80s when health and dieting was becoming evermore comerceialized. </p>
