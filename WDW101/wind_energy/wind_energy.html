  <h1> Michael's Wind & renewable energy</h1>

  <h3>started by Micheal and his close friend </h3>

  <p>Wind is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in motion. This is transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines or wind energy conversion systems. Wind first hits a turbine’s blades, causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them. 
    That changes the kinetic energy to rotational energy, by moving a shaft which is connected to a generator, and thereby producing electrical energy through <em>electromagnetism</em>.- <a href="https://www.irena.org/wind
    ">IRENA International Renewable Energy Agency</a></p>

   <p><strong><em>It's sustainable</em></strong>. Wind is actually a form of solar energy. Winds are caused by the heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the rotation of the Earth, and the Earth's surface irregularities. For as long as the sun shines and the wind blows,
   the energy produced can be harnessed to send power across the grid.-<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy">Office of Energy efficiency & Renewable Energy </a></p>

   <p>another form of wind collecting wind energy is offshore wind energy. off shore wind energy allows wind turbines to be built larger and closer to the cities that need the energy."We could run the whole east coast on offshore wind,” Amory Lovins, co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute.-<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-offshore-wind-energy">www.energy.gov</a> </p>

   <p>Makani Airborne Wind Turbine: The Makani Airborne Wind Turbine (AWT) can access stronger and more consistent wind at altitudes near 1,000 feet, which means that 85% of the US could have viable wind resources using the device (compared to just 15% using current turbine technology). The Makani turbine could also be deployed in deep offshore waters, which could lead to access to a renewable energy resource four times greater than the entire country's electrical generation capacity.-<a href="https://www.treehugger.com/future-wind-power-cool-innovations-4858207"><strogn>Trehugger</strogn>Sustainability for All</a></p>

   <h3>Wind Energy Facts</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The first modern wind turbine was built in the 1940’s in Vermont, USA</li>
  <li>The average onshore wind turbine can power more than 1,500 average EU households</li> 
  <li>A small turbine in the back yard can easily power a small business or a home</li>
</ul>
